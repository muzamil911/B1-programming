This repository contains weekly lab assignments from week 1 to week 15, except
week 10 that is already submitted separatly and week 12 which was not uploaded in moodle. 

We started from basics of programming and continued to object oriented programming and then at the end we also learned APIs and databases.


Most of these programs can be run automatically by calling them in the terminal or just pressing the run button on the 
right top corner of VS Code. (from week 1 to week 11). when running week 11 python file, the reslut will be saved in a .json file.

After week 11, in all other weeks (13, 14 and 15) we are dealing with APIs and database so we will go to the respective folder, eg: week_13
and then in the terminal we will run |  uvicorn main:app --reload  -or- uvicorn main:app --reload --port xxxx |
